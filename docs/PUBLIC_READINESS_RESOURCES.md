# Public Readiness Resources (Brova)

Purpose: a living checklist of external resources, integrations, and compliance references needed to make Brova production-ready for public launch in KSA/GCC and competitive with Salla/Zid-class platforms.

## 1) Payments & Checkout (Priority)
Resources to evaluate/integrate so merchants can accept local + global payment methods.

- Local rails & wallets: **mada**, **STC Pay**, **Apple Pay**, **Visa/Mastercard/Amex**
- BNPL: **Tabby**, **Tamara**
- 3DS / fraud tooling, risk rules, dispute flows
- Settlement, payouts, refunds, reconciliation
- Multi-currency support

Why: Salla lists native support for these payment methods and fraud/3DS, and positions this as core readiness. citeturn1search1

## 2) Tax & E‑Invoicing (ZATCA, KSA)
Resources needed to be compliant in Saudi Arabia.

- ZATCA Phase 2 (Integration) requirements
- Fatoora platform integration specs
- Required invoice fields, QR, and storage rules
- A certified e‑invoicing service or partner

Why: ZATCA continues rolling out Phase 2 waves with mandatory integration dates, and Salla explicitly highlights ZATCA compliance as a core platform feature. citeturn0search7turn1search1

## 3) Shipping & Fulfillment Network
Resources to provide broad carrier coverage and integrated fulfillment flows.

- Aggregator or direct carrier APIs (labels, rates, tracking, COD)
- Local/regional couriers (SMSA, Aramex, DHL, etc.)
- SLA monitoring and unified shipment status

Why: Salla positions 200+ shipping partners as a key advantage; Zid requires public shipping apps in its marketplace. citeturn1search1turn1search5

## 4) App Marketplace & Partner Ecosystem
Resources to enable a scalable ecosystem like Salla/Zid.

- Public app listing + approvals
- Developer docs & API access
- Partner dashboard (analytics, payouts, reviews)
- Support SLAs and partner compliance

Why: Salla advertises 900+ app integrations and Zid has a structured app marketplace and partner tooling. citeturn1search1turn1search5turn1search9

## 5) Theme Marketplace
Resources to let designers sell themes with analytics and payouts.

- Theme submission review pipeline
- Theme purchase, preview, activation metrics
- Partner payouts + licensing

Why: Zid supports theme analytics in the partner dashboard; Salla emphasizes marketplace extensibility. citeturn1search9turn1search1

## 6) POS & Omnichannel
Resources to support offline retail operations.

- POS hardware + inventory sync
- In‑store payments + returns
- Online/offline unified customer profile

Why: Salla highlights POS as a core product for merchants. citeturn1search1

## 7) Logistics Integrations (3PL / OMS)
Resources for enterprise fulfillment and warehouse workflows.

- 3PL/OMS integrations (e.g., external fulfillment platforms)
- Inventory sync + order status webhooks

Why: 3PLs like Salasa explicitly integrate with Salla/Zid/Shopify and position this as a must‑have. citeturn1search6

## 8) Support & Compliance Operations
Resources to operationalize merchant support and platform integrity.

- Merchant support channels & SLAs
- App support requirements for partners
- Fraud/dispute operations

Why: Zid’s partner docs define support requirements for public apps. citeturn1search0

## 9) Competitive Baseline Feature Set (Reference)
Use these as checkpoints to match baseline expectations.

- Salla: payments + ZATCA compliance, 200+ shipping partners, 900+ app integrations, fraud/3DS, multi‑currency. citeturn1search1
- Zid: app marketplace + partner tooling, shipping app ecosystem. citeturn1search5turn1search9

## Suggested Next Actions
1. Decide target launch country(ies) and prioritize compliance/payment rails accordingly.
2. Pick payment & shipping aggregator shortlists.
3. Define app marketplace MVP (public apps + reviews + payouts + support SLA).
4. Define ZATCA compliance plan and certified partner strategy.
